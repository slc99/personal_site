::: {#intro-blurb}
I am a first-year economics and computer science master's student at Duke University. I aspire to work on challenging problems that have a postive social impact. I want to work in the intersection of working on challenging problems and working with other people. I have a strong record of success in both. I am currently looking for a Summer 2025 internship where I can continue my experience and learn some new stuff. Ugh, writing is hard.

## Personal Interests
After a decade of rowing, I have recently gotten into cycling, running, and weighlifting. I enjoy all sorts of outdoor activites, such as hiking, biking, camping, climing, and especially skiing. I like to play board games, card games, and video games. I am an avid audiobook listener, especially of history books. I love traveling and seeing new places.
