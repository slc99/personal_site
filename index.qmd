::: {#intro-blurb}
I aspire to work on challenging data science problems with a positive social impact. Please see my [**projects**](projects/index.qmd) for a sample of my work.

I graduated from Seattle University with a triple major in Math, Economics, and Philosophy. I assisted in economics research and served as rowing team president. After graduating, I worked as an analyst at DaVita. There, I modeled complex multi-million dollar negotiations, automated and expanded team capabilities, and earned 'Rookie of the Year'. I am now earning an M.S. in Economics and Computer Science at Duke, a two-year, in-person program.

## Personal Interests
After a decade of rowing, I have recently started cycling and running. I enjoy all sorts of outdoor activities, such as hiking, biking, camping, and especially skiing. I like to play board games, card games, and video games. I am an avid audiobook listener, particularly of history books. I love traveling and seeing new places.
